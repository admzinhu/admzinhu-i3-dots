I hope you like this :]

Ok gang, so i spent a lot of time doing this and it ended up beautiful. But i didn't this alone. I adjusted some dotfiles that some people already made for everyone.
Thanks for @adi1090x, @catpuccin and @Keyitdev, because i grabbed some dotfiles from them and mixed up with my setup. To be honest, the only 2 things i made by myself was the i3 configuration and Picom configuration. <img width="1365" height="767" alt="i3rice" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e443bdf4-e910-461b-b19c-be1b91a2413e" />
Look? Isn't beautiful? Let's be honest: everyone loves ricing, and this little thing don't disappoint.

Ok, before you go to your terminal and type "git clone https://github.com/admzinhu/admzinhu-i3-dots", you need to know some things:

1 - I did this rice on Arch Linux. If you use other distro, you're by yourself on installing it correctly. I didn't got any installation script here yet, you need to wait or make your own and send to me [joke]

2 - There are some things you need to install. I think every distro got them, but you need to know what things you're going to install: alacritty, rofi, polybar, picom, i3, i3-gaps, sddm, pulseaudio, and some widgets, like cmatrix [yay version], fastfetch, htop, cava [adjust this thing for pulseaudio if you're going to use it], nano [i can't use vim/neovim for some reason, i'm staying with default lol] and feh for background. Remember: i3status sucks.

3 - My keyboard got some broken keys, and now the $mod key on i3 configuration is set to Control, but you can change for Mod4 [Win/Super].

4 - Everything now is by your own, and go thanks those guys for the rofi, sddm and polybar.
